Prolog Lab Topic Sequence

1.  Prolog up and running.   Concept of Database with no assertions.
2.  Working directory

      working_directory(X).
      change_directory('C:\\Users\\hanks\\Documents\\GitHub\\cpsc5610-fq19\\PrologLab').
  What does that tell us about how Prolog works?

3.  Assert by consulting a file 01.pl -- Two assertions, one a constant, one a variable.
       Consult the file
       Interesting one is bar(Z) 

4.  Socrates -- multiple answers to man(X) and of mortal(X).  Show how multiple answers work
       Also edit the file and consult it again -- add human + alive => person 

5.  West axioms
Notice the constants.  Use it for criminal(X) but also hostile(Z), missile(A) etc.
Show trace.

6.  04 Backtracking example.  Start with wrong notation!

7.  05 numbers
Do factorial:
factorial(X, 1) :- X =< 1.
factorial(X, Z) :- Y is X - 1, factorial(Y, Q), Z is Q * X.

Note multiple answers -- introduce the cut.

8.  Lists
First element of a list.
Second element of a list
Last element of a list

List member and not member
nodups([]).
nodups([F|R]) :- notmember(F, R), nodups(R).

notmember(_, []).
notmember(E, [E|_]) :- fail, !.
notmember(E, [F|R]) :- F \= E, notmember(E, R).

notmember2(E, L) :- \+ member(E, L).
